<h2> 2016 Season Outlook </h2>

<center> <div> <ul>
	<li> <strong> The Good News </strong> </li>
	   <ul>
			<li>   If the Bulldogs had to replace a coach, they did it with one of the nation’s star coordinators who has coached Alabama’s defense during four national championship seasons. The secondary could be among the best in the nation. If Sony Michel can fully recover from a broken arm, UGa will have the nation’s best one-two punch at running back, along with Nick Chubb. That and three of five offensive line starters returning will give either senior quarterback Greyson Lambert or five-star freshman Jacob Eason a nice security blanket.     </li>
	   </ul>
	<li> <strong> The Bad News </strong> </li>
	   <ul>
	        <li> The defensive weaknesses are at the front end, with Trenton Thompson the only interior lineman returning. Terry Godwin is the only experienced wide receiver back. Special teams will need an overhaul from a below-average season on returns and punting, along with the loss of kicker Marshall Morgan. The schedule includes North Carolina and Ole Miss in the first month and only two true home games in the first six weeks. </li>
	   </ul>
</ul> </div> </center>

<h2> Georgia's New Coach </h2>
<center> <div> <p> Georgia hired Alabama defensive coordinator Kirby Smart as its new head coach this season, hoping he can accomplish what has been routine for the Crimson Tide but eluded Mark Richt during his 15 years between the hedges:

Win a national championship. </p> </div> </center>
